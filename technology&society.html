            <hr class="hr_02">
            <p>Fake news can be defined as news that is presented as factual news, as in true information given to the
                consumers, but is in fact false and misleading information. Fake news is often used in a way to damage
                the reputation of a person or entity, or to make money through advertisements. When producing fake news,
                rhetorical devices are often used to capture attention and create trust within the consumers. <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/04/1115412" class="a_fakeNews"> Fake news </a>
                can therefore be very effective as a tool in various types of influence work. </p>

            <p>With increased knowledge of media use and access to various types of information technology, it has

                <hr class="hr_03">
                <p>Digital developments have led to an increased threat of fake news. It is becoming increasingly
                    difficult to distinguish between what is true from news and information online. As individuals in a
                    society, we can refrain from sharing misinformation that we cannot trace back to a safe and credible
                    source. Next, we should really think about what it is we are being informed about. Simple
                    information online can sometimes seem very strong and influential. Therefore, it would be best to
                    examine the sender more closely. All of this means that we have a <a href="https://parentbet.net/understanding-the-media/">critical understanding</a> of the
                    media, which enables us to use the media in a proven way, as well as combat the spread of fake news.

                    satire where there is no intention to cause harm, but has the potential to deceive the audience, or
                    have misleading content for the consumers. It can also simply be 100% fake where it is designed to
                    deceive and harm. </p>
