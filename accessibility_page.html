            <h2>Journey of La Mirabella`s website!</h2>
            <hr class="hr_02">
            <p>Before we started coding the website, we sat down to plan. We outlined how we wanted the website to be
                and distributed the work. The design on the website was put together based on inspiration from many
                websites. Despite the fact that we visited many different websites, we quickly saw the difference
                between a good and a not so good website. We saw that it was important to have a navigation bar that was
                easy to handle, both for those familiar with the website from before, but also for those visiting it for
                the first time. Furthermore, we saw that it was important to tell the user already on the main page what
                the website is about, and to have such a layout that saves the user time, and makes it easy to find
                where you are going.</p>

            <h3>Design/CSS</h3>
            <hr class="hr_03">
            <p>The design was well thought out. We wanted the design on each page to be the same, this to preserve the
                same theme and to reassure the user that the different pages were connected, as part of the same
                concept. We also think that for the sake of aesthetics, it looked nice. What we also had to think about
                was that the text should not disappear in the background colour, but that it was nice, clear and
                legible. we also made sure that there were clear contrasts so that all users can have the opportunity to
                read without problems. We made sure that the heading and subheading were the right size, and that the
                images were a good size. This is so that it does not become too large or too small on the mobile phone.
                We also took into account that the website was scalable to different screen sizes.</p>

                <h3>Accessibility test</h3>
                <hr class="hr_03">
                <p>We ran an Accessibility test and saw that the setup solution on the "Cafee" page was not good enough.
                    We had "Flip-up cards" on the menu (the picture is attached below). Every time the mouse would come
                    into contact with the flip-up card, it would turn around and show a picture of the dish itself. It
                    seemed like a lot of fun to get to code something like this, but we realized that this wasn't a
                    solution that was user-friendly for everyone. It may be that someone struggles to keep the mouse
                    button still over the card or for a very different reason has an illness or a disability that makes
                    this a problem. Another usability issue was an image we had chosen, which had a lot of flashing
                    lights. Here, we had not taken into account users who may suffer from epilepsy, so we replaced this
                    with a more user-friendly image.</p>
